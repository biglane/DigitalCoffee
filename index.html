      <div class="policy">
        <h3>Refund &amp; Dispute Policy</h3>
        <p>
          For digital products: if you are unsatisfied with a purchase, you may request a full refund within
          7 days by contacting us at
          <a href="mailto:support@digitalcoffee.dev">support@digitalcoffee.dev</a>.
          Please include the relevant URL or your payment receipt. Refunds are processed back to the
          original payment method within 5-10 business days.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a paid service fails to deliver (e.g., AI is unable to generate content), you will
          automatically receive a full refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          For design services: refund terms are outlined in individual project agreements.
        </p>

      <div class="policy">
        <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Digital product purchases (such as Tantrumify video generation) are one-time payments with no
          recurring charges or subscriptions. Since content is generated immediately upon payment,
          cancellations after generation has started are handled through our refund policy above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design service engagements may be cancelled according to the terms of the project agreement.
